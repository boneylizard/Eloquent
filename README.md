# Eloquent

**The most feature-complete local AI workstation. No subscriptions. No cloud dependency. Just your hardware.**

While everyone else ships another chat UI with fancy presets, Eloquent gives you **in-house Stable Diffusion**, **multi-GPU inference**, **voice cloning**, **model ELO testing**, **a tool-calling code editor**, **multi-role chat**, and **forensic linguistics** – all running locally.

Optional cloud APIs for when you want them. Your choice.

### What makes it different?
- **Single application**: LLM + image generation + voice + code tools + model evaluation
- **Multi-GPU that works**: Unified tensor splitting or dedicated GPU assignment
- **More than chat**: ELO testing framework, forensic linguistics, story state tracking, multi-role conversations
- **Production features**: Voice cloning, image upscaling, conversation summaries, agent mode

## 👥 Who This Is For

**Power users with NVIDIA GPUs** who want a complete local AI stack instead of juggling 5 different tools.

**Roleplayers & writers** who need multi-character conversations, story state, portraits, and voice in one app.

**Model evaluators** who want ELO testing and judge orchestration without building research infrastructure.

**Privacy-first users** who don't want conversations leaving their machine.

### Not for you if:

- You don't have an NVIDIA GPU
- You're on Mac or Linux (Windows only)

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Node.js v21.7.3 (recommended). Node 22 is untested; if the backend window closes when you use **Browse** for model/directory settings, try Node 21.7.3 or type the folder path manually.

### VRAM Guide

| Use Case | Recommended VRAM |
|----------|------------------|
| Small models (7B Q4) | 8GB |
| Medium models (13B-20B) | 12GB |
| Large models (70B+) | 24GB+ or multi-GPU |
| SD 1.5 | 4GB+ |
| SDXL/FLUX | 8GB+ |
| LLM + image gen together | 16GB+ or split across GPUs |

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boneylizard/Eloquent
cd Eloquent
install.bat    # Wait for completion (5-10 minutes)
run.bat
```

The installer handles everything: Python venv, PyTorch with CUDA 12.1, pre-built wheels, all dependencies.

**Default ports:**
- Backend: `http://localhost:8000`
- TTS: `http://localhost:8002`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`

Port conflicts are handled automatically - the frontend discovers actual ports.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Models
1. Settings → Model Settings → set GGUF directory
2. Model Selector → choose per-GPU or unified multi-GPU
3. Add OpenAI-compatible API endpoints if desired

### Images
1. Settings → Image Generation → set safetensors directory
2. ADetailer Models → point to YOLO `.pt` files
3. Upscaler Models → point to ESRGAN `.pth` files

### Voice
1. Settings → Audio → choose Kokoro or Chatterbox/Chatterbox Turbo
2. For cloning: upload reference sample
3. Enable Auto-TTS toggle in chat

### Multi-Role
1. Settings → enable Multi-Role Chat
2. Click roster button → add characters
3. Set talkativeness weights and voices
4. Optionally enable narrator

### Chess (Stockfish)
The **Chess** tab uses Stockfish for analysis. **Fresh installs:** `install.bat` runs the Stockfish installer automatically (downloads the official Windows build into `tools/stockfish/`). If that step failed (e.g. no network), run `install_stockfish.bat` or `python scripts/install_stockfish.py` from the repo root. You can also install [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/download/) manually and set **STOCKFISH_PATH** to the `stockfish.exe` path. Then open the Chess tab, set ELO and personality, and play as White; the AI plays Black with optional LLM commentary.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Missing dependencies | Run `install.bat` again or `pip install` the missing package |
| CUDA errors | Update NVIDIA drivers, ensure CUDA 12.x |
| Model won't load | Check VRAM, try smaller quantization |
| Port conflicts | Let auto-detection handle it or check processes on 8000/8002/5173 |
| TTS not working | Verify TTS service started in console |
| Import error on startup | Read traceback, activate venv, `pip install` the package |
| Context too large | Settings → adjust Context Window per endpoint |
| Agent Mode JSON errors | Hallucination Rescue should auto-fix, check console |
