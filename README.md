# Eloquent: Advanced Local AI Interface

Eloquent is a sophisticated, locally-hosted frontend for open-weight Large Language Models, designed around a dual-GPU architecture, advanced memory systems, and multi-modal AI interaction. It provides a powerful and private environment for interacting with, testing, and managing large language models with performance rivaling commercial AI platforms.

## Key Features

### High-Performance Dual-GPU Architecture

Eloquent is engineered to maximize performance through intelligent GPU resource allocation. The primary GPU handles model inference with optimized speeds (approximately 37 tokens/second on Gemma 3 27B with RTX 3090), while the secondary GPU manages memory operations, RAG processing, and auxiliary tasks. This architecture ensures responsive interactions even with large 27B+ parameter models.

### OpenAI-Compatible API Integration

- **Inbound API Support**: Full compatibility with OpenAI-compatible APIs including KoboldCPP streaming across networks  
- **Seamless Model Mixing**: Combine local GGUF models with remote API endpoints in the same interface  
- **Network Streaming**: Real-time streaming support for distributed inference setups  

### Intelligent Memory System

The application features a sophisticated persistent memory system that analyzes conversations using semantic embeddings and stores contextual information about user preferences, expertise areas, and conversation patterns. The memory system automatically injects relevant context into conversations, enabling truly personalized AI responses that evolve and improve over time through iterative alignment.

### Advanced Chat & Character System

- **Customizable AI Personas**: Create and customize AI characters with detailed backgrounds, personalities, speech patterns, and behavioral traits. Characters support rich metadata including world lore, dialogue styles, and memory preferences.

- **Dynamic Conversation Management**: Features include auto-generated chat titles using AI analysis, fully editable message history, conversation export/import, and intelligent context management  
- **World Lore Integration**: Build rich, consistent fictional worlds with a comprehensive lore book system  
- **Multi-Model Conversations**: Engage multiple models simultaneously in structured debates, comparisons, or collaborative discussions  

### Auto-Character Creator

Eloquent's revolutionary Auto-Character Creator streamlines character development through natural language interaction and intelligent JSON structure filling:

- Engage in natural dialogue with an AI about your character concept  
- Click Auto-Generate to trigger intelligent character sheet creation  
- The system analyzes conversation context and fills out comprehensive character data  
- **Smart Improvisation**: Fills gaps with consistent, creative details  
- **Iterative Refinement**: Modify characters using natural prompts  
- **Automated Avatar Generation**: Built-in Stable Diffusion prompt generation  
- **One-Click Deployment**: Saves characters directly to your permanent library
