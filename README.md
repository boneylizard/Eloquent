## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)
- **Python 3.12**
- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support (8GB+ VRAM recommended)
- **Node.js 18+** for the frontend

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/boneylizard/Eloquent.git
   cd Eloquent
   ```

2. **Run the installer**
   
   Double-click **`install.bat`** or run it from the command line:
   ```bash
   install.bat
   ```
   
   This automatically:
   - Creates a Python virtual environment
   - Installs all Python dependencies (including pre-built wheels for tricky packages)
   - Installs frontend dependencies

3. **Download a GGUF model**
   
   Place your model files in a directory and configure the path in Settings when you first run Eloquent.

### Running Eloquent

Simply double-click **`run.bat`** to start everything!

Or from the command line:
```bash
run.bat
```

This will launch:
- Backend API server on `http://localhost:8000`
- TTS service on `http://localhost:8002`  
- Frontend at `http://localhost:5173` (opens automatically in your browser)

#### Debug Mode

For troubleshooting with visible console windows:
```bash
run_debug.bat
```

## 🎮 Usage Tips

### For Roleplay
- Create detailed character cards with personality traits and example dialogues
- Use the **Story Tracker** to maintain consistency across long sessions
- Enable **Anti-Repetition Mode** in settings to reduce formulaic responses
- Use **Author's Note** to guide the AI's writing style for specific scenes

### For Creative Writing
- Use the **Choice Generator** for branching narrative options
- Enable web search for research-assisted writing
- Upload reference documents for RAG-enhanced responses

### For Voice
- Kokoro is faster for general use
- Chatterbox provides voice cloning - upload a 3+ second audio sample
- Enable **Auto-Play TTS** for hands-free conversation
