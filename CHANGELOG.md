### Fixed

* The **“Test Voice Settings”** button in the Audio tab now works.
* It plays a test voice using the currently selected text-to-speech engine (Kokoro or Chatterbox), allowing users to confirm their TTS configuration is working correctly.
* Fixed the Story Tracker so its contents are now correctly injected into the LLM context.
* The Story Tracker can be opened from the control panel, auto-filled by the AI, edited manually, or used in combination.
* Once closed, the tracked state (characters, inventory, locations, key events, etc.) is automatically formatted, persisted as structured continuity data, and injected into subsequent LLM messages.
